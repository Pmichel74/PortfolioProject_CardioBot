# System Architecture MVP

## Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate a scalable and efficient architecture for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It consists of a front-end application, a back-end server, a database, and integrations with external services.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **src**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **frontend**: Contains the front-end application code.
    - **components**: UI components used in the front-end.
    - **app.ts**: Entry point for the front-end application.
  - **backend**: Contains the back-end application code.
    - **controllers**: Business logic for handling requests.
    - **models**: Data models representing the application's data structure.
    - **routes**: API endpoint definitions.
  - **database**: Contains database-related files.
    - **migrations**: SQL commands for initializing the database.
    - **schemas**: Database schemas or models.
  - **services**: Functions or classes for interacting with external APIs.

- **docs**: Documentation files.
  - **architecture-diagram.md**: Architecture diagram illustrating system components and interactions.
  - **data-flow.md**: Description of data flow between components.

- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd system-architecture-mvp
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- The front-end application can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.
- The back-end API is available at `http://localhost:5000/api`.
