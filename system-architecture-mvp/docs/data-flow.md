# Data Flow in the MVP Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the data flow between the various components of the MVP architecture, detailing how data is transmitted and processed throughout the system.

## Components
1. **Front-end**
   - Framework: React
   - Responsibilities: User interface, user interactions, and data presentation.

2. **Back-end**
   - Framework: Node.js with Express
   - Responsibilities: Business logic, data processing, and API endpoints.

3. **Database**
   - Type: PostgreSQL
   - Responsibilities: Data storage, retrieval, and management.

4. **External Services**
   - APIs: Various third-party services for additional functionalities.

## Data Flow Description

1. **User Interaction**
   - Users interact with the front-end application, triggering events (e.g., form submissions, button clicks).

2. **Front-end to Back-end Communication**
   - The front-end sends HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST) to the back-end API endpoints defined in `src/backend/routes/index.ts`.
   - Data is sent in the request body or as query parameters.

3. **Back-end Processing**
   - The back-end receives requests and routes them to the appropriate controller methods defined in `src/backend/controllers/index.ts`.
   - Controllers process the requests, applying business logic and interacting with the database as needed.

4. **Database Interaction**
   - The back-end communicates with the database using models defined in `src/backend/models/index.ts` and schemas in `src/database/schemas/index.ts`.
   - SQL commands for data manipulation are executed, and results are retrieved.

5. **Response to Front-end**
   - After processing, the back-end sends responses back to the front-end, typically in JSON format.
   - The front-end receives the data and updates the UI accordingly.

6. **External API Calls**
   - If additional data is required, the back-end may make calls to external APIs using functions defined in `src/services/external-apis.ts`.
   - Responses from external services are processed and integrated into the back-end logic before being sent to the front-end.

## Conclusion
This data flow ensures a seamless interaction between the user interface, business logic, data storage, and external services, facilitating a responsive and efficient application.
