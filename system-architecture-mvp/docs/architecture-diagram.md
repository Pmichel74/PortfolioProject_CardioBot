# Architecture Diagram for MVP

## High-Level Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the MVP, illustrating the interaction between various components.

### Components

1. **Front-end**: 
   - Framework: React
   - Responsibilities: User interface, user interactions, and rendering components.

2. **Back-end**: 
   - Framework: Node.js with Express
   - Responsibilities: Business logic, API endpoints, and data processing.

3. **Database**: 
   - Type: PostgreSQL
   - Responsibilities: Data storage, retrieval, and management.

4. **External Services**: 
   - Example: OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.

### Data Flow

- **User Interaction**: 
  - Users interact with the front-end application, triggering events.

- **API Requests**: 
  - The front-end sends HTTP requests to the back-end API.

- **Business Logic**: 
  - The back-end processes requests, interacts with the database, and communicates with external services as needed.

- **Data Retrieval**: 
  - The back-end retrieves data from the database or external services and sends responses back to the front-end.

- **Rendering**: 
  - The front-end receives data and updates the user interface accordingly.

### Diagram

```
[User] --> [Front-end (React)] --> [Back-end (Node.js/Express)] --> [Database (PostgreSQL)]
                                   |
                                   --> [External Services (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)]
```

This architecture ensures scalability and efficiency by clearly defining the roles of each component and how they interact with one another.
